Alright, so I want to make a website that I can use to randomize a team of Operators to try and use in my current favorite mobil game, Arknights.

To do this, I want to have a section for the user to input numbers totaling to 12 next to the following titles:  Vanguard, Guard, Sniper, Defender, Medic, Supporter, Caster, and Specialist
Followed by a 'Randomize my team' button.

Upon pressing this button I would like for the code to select, at random, Operators from the respective lists, and display their names and e2(Elite 2, a term from the game) art on the page.

the biggest challenge is locating an API that I am able to use for this.  I may just create my own in the end.



UPDATE:   Due to the difficulty of randomly selecting from specific classes, I will instead be selecting 1 absolutely random operator at a time and will work upwards from there.

UPDATE_2:  Alright, I managed to get it to select a random operator and display several stats about that operator.
Now I need to make a way for it to take that information and let the user 'add that operator to their team'.
After I accomplish that, and limit the team to a max of 12 operators, then I will work on formatting.
