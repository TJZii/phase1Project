# phase1Project


Hello, and welcome!  My name is Tristan Hawes, and this here is a character Randomizer for a mobile game called Arknights.

In order to use this site for yourself, please go to the repository at the following link: https://github.com/TJZii/phase1Project, Download the repository, and simply open index.html in your web Browser.  The site itself should guide you through the rest of these steps.

For those unfamiliar with Arknights, it is a tower defence mobile game where you are the 'Doctor' of Rhodes Island, a master Tactician.  You face levels called combat stages with a squad of 12 Operators, the in-game term for the characters.

The reason I created this site is because, on occassion, I like to have a bit of chaos as added challenge to the game, so I created a site that would randomly select 12 operators and construct a squad for me.  

Thanks to Sarah Ting for the use of her API that she created for one of her projects, which was used in my fetch statement to get the data presented on the page.
